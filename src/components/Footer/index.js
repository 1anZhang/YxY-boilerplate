          Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by
          dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise
          of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage
          to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to
          become. Everything else is secondary.
